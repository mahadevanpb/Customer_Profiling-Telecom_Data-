# Telecommunications Customer Profiling

This project provides a Python-based solution for profiling telecommunications customers. The goal is to analyze customer behavior over a six-month period to gain a better understanding of their loyalty and free data bonus usage, and to classify them into strategic service tiers.

### Key Features
<b>Data Analysis</b>: Analyzes a six-month dataset of customer transactions.

<b>Loyalty Scoring</b>: Calculates a "Loyalty Score" for each customer based on their frequency of data plan purchases.

<b>Bonus Usage Scoring</b>: Calculates a "Bonus Usage Score" based on how a customer utilizes their free internet data bonuses.

<b>Tier Classification</b>: Combines the two scores to assign each customer to one of four strategic tiers:

- Tier 1 Priority Service

- Tier 2 Priority Service

- Tier 3 Priority Service + Incentives

- Tier 4 Priority Marketing + Incentives

Output: Generates a comprehensive profile for each customer, including their final score percentage and assigned tier.
